    In this Project, i tried to build a small application that could detect the disease of potato plant using a trained model using tensorflow , the model is trained on three categories of potato which are : <br>
      * Potato___Early_blight<br>
      * Potato___Late_blight<br>
      * Potato___healthy<br><br>
    So giving an image in your gallery or by taking it using your camera the model return the predicted class of the plant image.<br>
